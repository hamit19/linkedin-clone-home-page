The project is about a LinkedIn clone home page. I've used React js (hooks), Redux (redux toolkit), CSS3 and Firebase v9 to implement the project.

The features of the project:
1. Authentication ( signup, signIn).
2. Adding a post with the user's information.
3. Editing the post that user has added.
4. Deleting the post that user has added.
